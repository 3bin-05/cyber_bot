# Integration of AI Scam Detection into Cyber Bot

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Add json import to bot.py
- [x] Add OPENROUTER_API_KEY environment variable
- [x] Implement ai_scam_check function using OpenRouter API with mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct model
- [x] Integrate AI check into analyze_message function: boost risk for SCAM (>=80%), add AI reason to detection reasons
- [x] Test compilation of bot.py (no syntax errors)

## Next Steps

- Set OPENROUTER_API_KEY in environment
- Test the bot with sample messages to verify AI integration
- Monitor API usage and adjust as needed
